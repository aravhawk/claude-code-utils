# Core rules (must follow)
- Don't overcomplicate tasks.
- Always check the web for up-to-date info and documentation.
- Always cross-reference with Context7.
- Plan every edge case when architecting any plan/product/feature.
- Keep requirements file(s) up to date.
- Always read `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` before starting any task.
- Keep project details in `CLAUDE.md` and/or `AGENTS.md` up to date.
- Ensure `.gitignore` excludes unnecessary files/folders (e.g., `.DS_Store`, `__pycache__`, `.idea`). Use judgment so no unnecessary files are added to git. Do not exclude `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or `.cursorrules`.
- Never use venvs. When project-specific environments are needed, use conda.
- Minimize use of emojis, especially in code and docs.

## Preferences
- Prefer `pnpm` over `npm` unless instructed otherwise.
- Prefer `git` via SSH over HTTPS unless instructed otherwise.
- Call me Arav.
- My GitHub username is aravhawk.
