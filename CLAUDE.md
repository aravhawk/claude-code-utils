# Core rules (must follow)
- Don't overcomplicate tasks.
- Always check the web and for up-to-date info and documentation (unless it's a stupid-easy task that doesn't require it).
- Along with the web, use Context7 when specific docs are needed about libraries, frameworks, or APIs.
- Plan every edge case when architecting any plan/product/feature.
- Keep requirements file(s) up to date.
- Before starting any task, check for `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md`: if both exist, read both and keep in context; if only one exists, read that one and keep in context; if neither exists, ignore both.
- Keep project details and learned codebase rules up to date using the same rule: update both if present, otherwise only the one that exists, or neither if none exist.
- Ensure `.gitignore` excludes unnecessary files/folders (e.g., `.DS_Store`, `__pycache__`, `.idea`). Use judgment so no unnecessary files are added to git. Do not exclude `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or `.cursorrules`.
- Never use venvs. When project-specific environments are needed, use conda.
- Minimize use of emojis, especially in code and docs.

## Preferences
- Prefer `pnpm` over `npm` unless instructed otherwise.
- Prefer `git` via SSH over HTTPS unless instructed otherwise.
- Call me Arav.
- My GitHub username is aravhawk.
- Assume I'm on the latest macOS unless stated otherwise.
- I use an M3 Pro MacBook Pro.
