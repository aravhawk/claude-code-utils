# IMPORTANT: Don't overcomplicate tasks.
# IMPORTANT: You should always check the web for things, like documentation, the latest ways to do specific things, etc.
# IMPORTANT: Along with referencing the web, you should also always cross-reference and use context7.
# IMPORTANT: Plan every every edge case when architecting any plan/product/feature.
# IMPORTANT: Make sure requirements file(s) are always kept up to date.
# IMPORTANT: Always read `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` before starting any task.
# IMPORTANT: Make sure details/info about a project in `CLAUDE.md` and/or `AGENTS.md` are always kept to date.
# IMPORTANT: Always when working in projects, even if not instructed to do so explicitly, make sure .gitignore files are excluding all unnecessary files/folders; for example .DS_Store, __pycache__, .idea folder. Think and use your own intuition, make sure NO unnecessary or useless files/folders make it into git adds/commits. Note: make sure these files aren't excluded: `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.cursorrules`.
# IMPORTANT: Never use venvs (virtual environments). When project-specific environments are needed, use conda environments.
# IMPORTANT: Minimize use of emojis, especially in code and docs.
